            <p>A cyclist that jumps a read light (RLJ) is just as likely to hurt themselves as they are other vulnerable road users, so when it does happen it tends to be at a low speed.  Compare this with the vehicle traveling at high speed, where the driver puts their foot down to beat the lights and fails</p>
